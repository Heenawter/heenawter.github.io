			<h2>Question #1</h2>
            <h3>What genre should your video be?</h3>
			<!-- <h3>What genre will give you the best user interaction?</h3> -->
			<p>
                The trending page of YouTube is broken down into <span class='number'>15</span> different categories.
                One possible subset of the more popular genres, in no particular order, is as follows:

                <!-- 'Autos & Vehicles', 'Comedy', 'Education', 'Entertainment',
                       'Film & Animation', 'Gaming', 'Howto & Style', 'Music',
                       'News & Politics', 'Nonprofits & Activism', 'People & Blogs',
                       'Pets & Animals', 'Science & Technology', 'Shows', 'Sports',
                       'Travel & Events' -->

                <ul class="row">
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Comedy</li>
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Gaming</li>
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Entertainment</li>
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Music</li>
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Howto & Style</li>
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Sports</li>
                </ul>

                With such a large variety of options to choose from, which category should you make content for?
                Obviously, the most obvious answer would be to make content for the genre you are passionate about and talented in.
                After all, if you are hopeleslly tonedeaf, it may not be worth your time to persue a career in music.

                That being said, let us approach this problem as though each genre of video is equally likely and enjoyable.
                Considering this, what factors would influence our decision on which category to aim for?
            </p>
            <hr class='divideme'>
            <p>
                One of the first things that comes to mind when hearing that a video is 'popular' on YouTube is likely the number of
                views a specific video gets.
                It is unlikely, for example, that a video with under <span class='number'>500</span> views
                would be considered 'popular' by the general YouTube audience.
                The number of views also impacts how much revenue a specific video will pull in, which is Important
                if you intend to make this YouTube thing a career.
                Considering these things,
                it makes sense to start by looking at views in order to determine which category
                is most likely to achieve the best results.
            </p>

            <figure class="full-width">
                <img src="./images/CategoryViewsTotal.png" class="img-fluid"/>
                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 1</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                As can be seen above, the <span class='emph'>Music</span> category far outweighs the other genres in terms of overall views.
                In comparison to the second-most viewed category (Entertainment), <span class='emph'>Music</span> has approximately
                <span class='number'>30-million</span> more; this is nearly double the number of views!
                With some thought, this result is fairly unsurprising.
                First off, music is universably shareable.
                This is especially true due to the lack of a language barrier when it comes to music in comparison to other forms of digital media.
                Although you may not understand the lyrics of a particular song, that by no means impacts your ability to enjoy it.
                As a result, it is not uncommon for music videos to trend in multiple countries.
                For example, here's a <i>small</i> subset of the <span class='number'>55</span> different music videos that made the trending page of every
                country in our dataset:

                <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
                    <p class="mb-0">'MIC Drop (Steve Aoki Remix)' Official MV</p>
                    <footer class="blockquote-footer">By <cite title="Source Title">BTS (방탄소년단)</cite></footer>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
                    <p class="mb-0">End Game ft. Ed Sheeran, Future</p>
                    <footer class="blockquote-footer">By <cite title="Source Title">Taylor Swift</cite></footer>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
                    <p class="mb-0">Man of the Woods (Official Video)</p>
                    <footer class="blockquote-footer">By <cite title="Source Title">Justin Timberlake</cite></footer>
                </blockquote>


                In comparison, the next most universally shared category was Entertainment with only <span class='number'>29</span> videos that made every trending page,
                which is almost <span class='emph2'>half</span> of the number of music videos that met the same condition.
                The category 'Film & Animation' had <span class='number'>15</span> of these videos, and all the remaining categories had <span class='number'>10</span> or less.
                Of the fifteen possible categories, <span class='number'>3</span> of them had the minimum value of <span class='number'>1</span>.
                This helps to  illustrate our idea that music videos are more universally shareable in comparison to the other categories.
            </p>

            <!-- <p>
                Music videos also have one of the highest <span class='emph2'>replayability</span> factors in comparison to the other categories.
                If you like a song, it is unlikely you only want to listen to it once.
                You want to listen to it over and over until you know it by heart.
                While other music streaming services exist, YouTube is still a popular resource to get your music fix.
                After all, this is the reason why the paid-for-subscription-service YouTube Red has an option to stream music in a manner not unlike Spotify.
                Other forms of media do not tend to have this same replayability factor;
                even

                It is not uncommon for people without access to some other music streaming service to make use of YouTube's multitude of musical content.
                After all, this is the reason why the paid-for-subscription-service YouTube Red has an option to stream music in a manner not unlike Spotify.
                As a result, one person may watch the same video <i>multiple</i> times in order to get the musical fix.

                This is just another explanation for why this category dominates the other categories in terms of views.
            </p> -->
            <hr class='divideme'>
            <p>
                Despite the <span class='emph'>Music</span> category getting the most views overall,
                the future is not-so-bleak for the other categories.
                Figure 2 below illustrates the number of views (per day) music videos get in comparison to all other categories.
                It is worth mentioning that this figure was constructed using the <span class='emph2'>sampled</span> version of our dataset.
                This helped to normalize the results, since only <span class='number'>5</span> videos from each category (per day) were included.
                <!-- I tried constructing this same graph with both versions of my dataset, and I found this one to be the most interesting. -->
            </p>

            <figure class="full-width">
                <img src="./images/CategoryViewsOverTime.png" class="img-fluid"/>
                  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 2</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Figure 2 shows that the views of the videos in the <span class='emph'>Music</span> category as well as in
                all <span class='emph2'>other</span> categories (when considered as a whole) are on the rise.
                In fact, the views trend line for 'Other' seems to have a slightly steeper slope than the one for music videos.
                This shows that, while music videos may get more views overall than all other categories,
                views in general are on an upward trend.
                As a result, the future of views looks promising <i>regardless</i> of the video category you choose.

            </p>
            <hr class='divideme'>
            <p>
                However, views are not all that matters when it comes to choosing a category that fits you best.
                For example, you may be someone who values user comments and direct communication with your audience
                more than simply the number of views.
                On the other hand, you may be heavily impacted by negative feedback, so you'd prefer to pick a category
                that is more likely to keep things positive.
                These are other factors, besides views, that may impact your decision of which category to produce
                content for.
            </p>
            <p>
                Figure 3 below shows the breakdown of user interaction per category, as described by
                the average number of comments, likes, and dislikes on the videos.
                Since the views of every category far outweighed any other interaction factor (and since I've already
                heavily discussed views above), I chose not to include the percentage of user interaction that comes
                from views. This helped give more insight into the other factors.
            </p>

            <figure class="full-width">
                <img src="./images/InteractionBreakdown.png" class="img-fluid"/>
                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 3</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Using Figure 3, we can answer the above hypothetical examples. If user comments are an important factor for you when making your videos,
                then the category <span class='emph2'>'Nonprofits & Activism'</span> is for you.
                This can be seen by the fact that this category has <span class='number'>21%</span> of its user interaction coming from comments,
                which is the most out of any other category. Interestingly, this category also has a higher than average percentage of
                dislikes, coming in at <span class='number'>14.5%</span>. As a result, this may not be the best category for the second scenario where
                negative feedback is extremely undesirable. Instead, the best categories for this scenario would be <span class='emph2'>'Pets & Animals'</span> (with only <span class='number'>1.7%</span> of
                user interaction coming from dislikes) or <span class='emph2'>'Comedy'</span> (which has only <span class='number'>2.7%</span>).

			<h2>Question #2</h2>
			<h3>Which language should your title be?</h3>
			<p>
                Depending on the language you speak, it's possible that your video may not trend.
                After all, making a video in a language that does not fall into the majority limits the potential size of the audience
                for that video, which goes against the fundamental idea behind the trending page.
                Trending videos are meant to target as wide of an audience as possible, so it makes sense to publish a video in one of the top
                languages if you want to increase your chances of making this list.
            </p>

            <hr class='divideme'>

            <p>
                Then, let's start by looking at the diversity of each trending page.
                In the context of this analysis, <span class='emph2'>diversity</span>
                is measured by the number of unique lanugages detected for the titles of each country's page.

                Overall, my <span class='emph2'>sampled</span> dataset had a total of <span class='number'>78</span> unique languages used for the titles.
                In the full dataset, the number of unique languages is most
                likely actually much larger.
                Still, I was able to get a good understanding of the breakdown of the <span class='emph2'>majority</span>
                languages, and this analysis can be seen in Table 1.

                The percentage breakdown of each of these languages can be seen in Figure 4.
                Note that these percentages do not represent the <i>overall</i> percentages of titles on each trending page.
                Instead, I removed any video that was not in one of the above languages and did my analysis on this subset of data.
                As a result, the actual percentages for each language will be slightly smaller.
                However, this percentage difference was minimal when compared to the overall breakdown;
                so, I chose to sacrifice a small amount of accuracy in favour of readibility by reducing the number of
                languages presented on each bar.
            </p>

            </figure>

            <p>
                In both Table 1 and Figure 4, we can see that <span class='number'>3</span> out of <span class='number'>5</span>
                of the trending pages in my dataset had a majority of <span class='emph'>English</span> videos.
                In fact, the United States and United Kingdom were both so English-dominated (over <span class='number'>95%</span>)
                that the remaining percentages of languages are nearly invisible in the language breakdown.
                However, these results were not that far from my expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the UK, <span class='number'>92%</span> of the population considered <span class='emph'>English</span> to be their
                main language in 2013 according to the BBC [<a href='http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-21259401'>source</a>].
                The USA, on the other hand, has approximately <span class='number'>70%</span> of their population made up of native
                <span class='emph'>English</span> speakers [<a href='https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/most-spoken-languages-in-the-us'>source</a>].
                That being said, it was slightly surprising that the American trending page was not slightly more diverse.
                Despite <span class='number'>11%</span> people in the United States speaking Spanish natively, only <span class='number'>5</span>
                video titles in my sampled dataset were in Spanish. In comparison, France's dataset contained <span class='number'>28</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                While it is not reasonable to draw a direct connection between the titles of YouTube's trending page and that
                country's actual diversity, I still found this result to be interesting.
                That being said, it is entirely possible that my sampling process somehow missed many of the non-<span class='emph'>English</span> videos
                and thus skewed the results in one way or the other.
                As a result, these percentages are not actually representative of the languages spoken in a specific country.
                Regardless, this still presents an interesting look at the languages that dominated each trending page.
            </p>
<!--
            <p>
                A result that <i>did</i> surprise me was Canada. As a country that prides itself on being diverse, still an
                overwhelmingly high majority of their videos were <span class='emph'>English</span>: nearly <span class='number'>90%</span>.

            </p> -->

            <hr class='divideme'>

            <p>
                Next, I wanted to see if the trending pages of YouTube were
                becoming more or less dominated by <span class='emph'>English</span> videos over time.
                So, I took the <span class='emph2'>top 3</span> diverse countries from above (France, Germany, and Canada)
                and mapped their English use VS all other languages.
                The results for this can be seen in Figure 5 below.
                It is worth mentioning that I returned to the
               <i>entire</i> language list for this analysis unlike in the analysis above;
               hence, the 'Other' category consists of <span class='number'>76</span> different languages.
            </p>

            <figure class="full-width">
                <img src="./images/LanguageTrends.png" class="img-fluid"/>
                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 5</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Figure 5 shows that the trend for  <span class='emph'>English</span> videos making the trending page
                is slightly positive wheras the 'Other' category seems to be on a gentle decline.
                While the 'Other' languages outweigh the English videos in this subset of the data on almost every day, there are
                <span class='number'>2</span> days where English overtakes the other languages:
                January 28th and March 5th in 2018. While I could not find any explanation for the increase in January,
                the Oscars took place on March 4th, which may explain the increase in English videos on the trending page the day after.

            </p>

            <hr class='divideme'>
            <p>
                So, based on the above, it is fair to conclude that a video with a title in <span class='emph'>English</span> is more likely
                to trend than titles in any other languages.
                Both French and German are also good choices, although you are less likely to trend globally with these languages as your title.
                Of the  <span class='number'>23</span> videos that made every single trending page, only
                <span class='number'>1</span> of them was classified as non-English.

                However, upon further inspection of this video, it turns out it was actually Troye Sivan's music video for his song 'My My My!'
                Despite being in English, the title had been mis-classified by the Google API as <span class='emph2'>Russian</span>.
                So, in reality, not a single one of these videos was non-English.
                Hence, <span class='emph'>English</span> is still the best overall choice if you want to make the trending page.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a reminder, I had to use the <span class='emph2'>sampled</span> version of my dataset
                in order to accomodate for translation limitations in this analysis question.
                It is also worth mentioning that I assumed the language used for the title represents the language used in the video itself.
                Obviously, this is not always the case. However, this still provides a decent approximation while still accomodating for
                my limited translation capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                One other limitation of this analysis is that the Google API used for translation is not <span class='number'>100%</span> accurate with its language detection.
                This was demonstrated above, with Troy Sivan's video being mislabeled as Russian despite being in English.
                However, there is not much that can be done to improve this limitation with today's tools;
                after all, Google Translate is one of the best tools on the market to perform this type of analysis.

            <h2>Question #3</h2>
            <h3>How should you title / tag your video?</h3>
            <p>
                One of the first things a potential viewer will see of your video is the title.
                Because of this, it's important to pick a title that will draw them in and make them want to click.

                Now, there are a variety of techniques that are designed to do just that.
                For example, clickbait, although disingenuous, is one method that is known to work.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to the American Marketing Association, one video with a normal title recieved only
                <span class='number'>1-million</span> views, whereas the same video, rebranded with a clickbait title,
                was able to pull in <span class='number'>17-million</span>
                [<a href='https://www.ama.org/publications/MarketingInsights/Pages/one-writer-explored-the-marketing-science-behind-clickbait.aspx'>source</a>].
                This is due to the <span class='emph2'>information gap theory</span>, which states that
                "humans have an insatiable appetite to indulge their curiosity"
                [<a href='https://www.ama.org/publications/MarketingInsights/Pages/one-writer-explored-the-marketing-science-behind-clickbait.aspx'>source</a>].
                While clickbait is proven, we want to see if there are any <i>other</i> cominalities in the titles of trending videos.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the analysis to follow, it is worth mentioning that I was once again limited to the <span class='emph2'>sampled</span>
                version of the dataset. Not only did I want to prevent biases towards English titles and words, I was also unsure of the reliability of my
                sentiment analysis tool for non-English words.
                In order to keep things as equal as I could, I chose to stick to my translated titles rather than the full dataset.
            </p>

            <hr class='divideme'>
            <p>
                Let's start by looking at the <span class='emph2'>most used words</span> in the titles of these trending videos
                (excluding stopwords such as 'the,' which provide no insight).
                Beyond that, let's examine whether words of a specific <i>sentiment</i> are more common in titles than others.
                While making a title using these specific words will by no means guarantee trending status,
                it will provide an insight on what <i>kinds</i> of words may increase your chances.
                The results of this analysis are shown in Figure 6.
            </p>

             <figure class="full-width">
                 <img src="./images/TitleWordCloud.png" class="img-fluid"/>
                 <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 6</figcaption>
             </figure>

             <p>
                 In the above, the size of the font corresponds to the number of times that specific word occurs in the trending
                 video's titles. The colour, in this case, is the algorithm-determined <i>sentiment</i> of that word:
                 red is <span class='emph'>positive</span> (a polarity score of greater than <span class='number'>0</span>),
                 dark gray is <span class='emph2'>negative</span> (polarity less than <span class='number'>0</span>), and
                 light gray is neutral. The library <span class='number'>TextBlob</span> was used for this sentiment score.
             </p>

             <p>
                 It is apparent right away that sentiment analysis is hardly a perfect tool.
                 Looking at Figure 6, we can see that some words were classified as either <span class='emph'>positive</span> or
                 <span class='emph2'>negative</span> in some strange ways.
                 For example, 'green' is labeled as <span class='emph2'>negative</span> despite the fact that colours, by nature,
                 are fairly neutral. Perhaps this is due to its usage in idioms such as "green with envy" or 
             </p>

             <figure class="full-width">
