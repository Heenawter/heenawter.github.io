            <h2>What is the goal of this data story?</h2>
            <p class='lead'> Have you ever wondered what it takes to make the trending page of YouTube?
                The goal of this data story is to answer this question as best as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to accomplish this, I have two versions of the same dataset to consider: one which contains every
                single video that has trended since <span class='emph2'>November 14th, 2017</span> and a sampled
                version. The sampled version reduces the number of rows from <span class='number'>116,738</span> to
                <span class='number'>34,110</span>, and was created in order to accommodate for translation limitations.
                Specifically, in order to perform parts of the analysis to follow, the title column needed to be translated;
                since the Google API that was used for this task had a set character limit, the dataset had to be sampled in
                order for this to happen.
                In each question below, it will be clearly stated which dataset was used in order to perform the analysis.

			<h2>Question #1</h2>
            <h3>What genre should your video be?</h3>
			<!-- <h3>What genre will give you the best user interaction?</h3> -->
			<p>
                The trending page of YouTube is broken down into <span class='number'>15</span> different categories.
                One possible subset of the more popular genres, in no particular order, is as follows:

                <!-- 'Autos & Vehicles', 'Comedy', 'Education', 'Entertainment',
                       'Film & Animation', 'Gaming', 'Howto & Style', 'Music',
                       'News & Politics', 'Nonprofits & Activism', 'People & Blogs',
                       'Pets & Animals', 'Science & Technology', 'Shows', 'Sports',
                       'Travel & Events' -->

                <ul class="row">
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Comedy</li>
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Gaming</li>
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Entertainment</li>
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Music</li>
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Howto & Style</li>
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Sports</li>
                </ul>

                With such a large variety of options to choose from, which category should you make content for?
                Obviously, the most obvious answer would be to make content for the genre you are passionate about and talented in.
                After all, if you are hopelessly tone deaf, it may not be worth your time to pursue a career in music.

                That being said, let us approach this problem as though each genre of video is equally likely and enjoyable.
                Considering this, what factors would influence our decision on which category to aim for?
            </p>
            <hr class='divideme'>
            <p>
                One of the first things that comes to mind when hearing that a video is 'popular' on YouTube is likely the number of
                views a specific video gets.
                It is unlikely, for example, that a video with under <span class='number'>500</span> views
                would be considered 'popular' by the general YouTube audience.
                The number of views also impacts how much revenue a specific video will pull in, which is Important
                if you intend to make this YouTube thing a career.
                Considering these things,
                it makes sense to start by looking at views in order to determine which category
                is most likely to achieve the best results.
            </p>

            <figure class="cf full-width">
                <img src="./images/CategoryViewsTotal_Hover.png" class="img-fluid bottom" />
                <img src="./images/CategoryViewsTotal.png" class="img-fluid top"/>

                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 1*</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                As can be seen above, the <span class='emph'>Music</span> category far outweighs the other genres in terms of overall views.
                In comparison to the second most viewed category (Entertainment), <span class='emph'>Music</span> has approximately
                <span class='number'>30-million</span> more; this is nearly double the number of views!
                With some thought, this result is fairly unsurprising.
                First off, music is universally shareable.
                This is especially true due to the lack of a language barrier when it comes to music in comparison to other forms of digital media.
                Although you may not understand the lyrics of a particular song, that by no means impacts your ability to enjoy it.
                As a result, it is not uncommon for music videos to trend in multiple countries.
                For example, here's a <i>small</i> subset of the <span class='number'>55</span> different music videos that made the trending page of every
                country in our dataset:

                <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
                    <p class="mb-0">'MIC Drop (Steve Aoki Remix)' Official MV</p>
                    <footer class="blockquote-footer">By <cite title="Source Title">BTS (방탄소년단)</cite></footer>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
                    <p class="mb-0">End Game ft. Ed Sheeran, Future</p>
                    <footer class="blockquote-footer">By <cite title="Source Title">Taylor Swift</cite></footer>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
                    <p class="mb-0">Man of the Woods (Official Video)</p>
                    <footer class="blockquote-footer">By <cite title="Source Title">Justin Timberlake</cite></footer>
                </blockquote>


                In comparison, the next most universally shared category was Entertainment with only <span class='number'>29</span> videos that made every trending page;
                this is almost <span class='emph2'>half</span> of the number of music videos that met the same condition.
                The category 'Film & Animation' had <span class='number'>15</span> of these videos, and all the remaining categories had <span class='number'>10</span> or less.
                Of the fifteen possible categories, <span class='number'>3</span> of them had the minimum value of <span class='number'>1</span>.
                This helps to  illustrate our idea that music videos are more universally shareable in comparison to the other categories.
            </p>

            <hr class='divideme'>
            <p>
                Despite the <span class='emph'>Music</span> category getting the most views overall,
                the future is not-so-bleak for the other categories.
                Figure 2 below illustrates the number of views (per day) music videos get in comparison to all other categories.
                It is worth mentioning that this figure was constructed using the <span class='emph2'>sampled</span> version of our dataset.
                This helped to normalize the results, since only <span class='number'>5</span> videos from each category (per day) were included.
            </p>

            <figure class="cf full-width">
                <img src="./images/CategoryViewsOverTime_Hover.png" class="img-fluid bottom" />
                <img src="./images/CategoryViewsOverTime.png" class="img-fluid top"/>
                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 2*</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Figure 2 shows that the views of the videos in the <span class='emph'>Music</span> category as well as in
                all <span class='emph2'>other</span> categories (when considered as a whole) are on the rise.
                In fact, the views trend line for 'Other' seems to have a slightly steeper slope than the one for music videos.
                This shows that, while music videos may get more views overall than all other categories,
                views in general are on an upward trend.
                As a result, the future of views looks promising <i>regardless</i> of the video category you choose.

            </p>
            <hr class='divideme'>
            <p>
                However, views are not all that matters when it comes to choosing a category that fits you best.
                For example, you may be someone who values user comments and direct communication with your audience
                more than simply the number of views.
                On the other hand, you may be heavily impacted by negative feedback, so you'd prefer to pick a category
                that is more likely to keep things positive.
                These are other factors, besides views, that may impact your decision of which category to produce
                content for.
            </p>
            <p>
                Figure 3 below shows the breakdown of user interaction per category, as described by
                the average number of comments, likes, and dislikes on the videos.
                Since the views of every category far outweighed any other interaction factor (and since I've already
                heavily discussed views above), I chose not to include the percentage of user interaction that comes
                from views. This helped give more insight into the other factors.
            </p>

            <figure class="cf full-width">
                <img src="./images/InteractionBreakdown_Hover.png" class="img-fluid bottom"/>
                <img src="./images/InteractionBreakdown.png" class="img-fluid top"/>
                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 3*</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Using Figure 3, we can answer the above hypothetical examples. If user comments are an important factor for you when making your videos,
                then the category <span class='emph2'>'Nonprofits & Activism'</span> is for you.
                This can be seen by the fact that this category has <span class='number'>21%</span> of its user interaction coming from comments,
                which is the most out of any other category. Interestingly, this category also has a higher than average percentage of
                dislikes, coming in at <span class='number'>14.5%</span>. As a result, this may not be the best category for the second scenario where
                negative feedback is extremely undesirable. Instead, the best categories for this scenario would be <span class='emph2'>'Pets & Animals'</span> (with only <span class='number'>1.7%</span> of
                user interaction coming from dislikes) or <span class='emph2'>'Comedy'</span> (which has only <span class='number'>2.7%</span>).
            </p>

            <!-- <p>
                It is interesting to see that, regardless of the category, the number of likes makes up the <i>majority</i> of
                the user interaction score. Out of all categories, however, likes in <span class='emph'>Music</span> make up the
                highest percentage overall.
                However, this makes sense. In general, videos tend to have a more positive than negative reaction,
                and leaving a like is a lot less work
                than writing a comment. Hence, it makes sense that a majority of user interaction comes from likes.
                That being said, some categories (such as <span class='emph2'>'Entertainment'</span>)
                have more of their interaction come from comments versus dislikes.

			<h2>Question #2</h2>
			<h3>Which language should you speak?</h3>
			<p>
                Depending on the language you speak, it's possible that your video may not trend.
                After all, making a video in a language that does not fall into the majority limits the potential size of the audience
                for that video, which goes against the fundamental idea behind the trending page.
                Trending videos are meant to target as wide of an audience as possible, so it makes sense to publish a video in one of the top
                languages if you want to increase your chances of making this list.
            </p>

            <hr class='divideme'>

            <p>
                Then, let's start by looking at the diversity of each trending page.
                In the context of this analysis, <span class='emph2'>diversity</span>
                is measured by the number of unique languages detected for the titles of each country's page.

                Overall, my sampled dataset had a total of <span class='number'>78</span> unique languages used for the titles while,
                in the full dataset, the number of unique languages is most likely much larger.
                Still, I was able to get a good understanding of the breakdown of the <span class='emph2'>majority</span>
                languages, and this analysis can be seen in Table 1.

                Since there was a lot of overlap in these top <span class='number'>5</span> lists, I ended up only looking at <span class='number'>12</span>
                different languages:

                <ul class="row">
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">English</li>
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">French</li>
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Chinese</li>
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Hindi</li>
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">German</li>
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Turkish</li>
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Russian</li>
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Arabic</li>
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Haitian Creole</li>
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Korean</li>
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Japanese</li>
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Portuguese</li>
                </ul>

                The percentage breakdown of each of these languages can be seen in Figure 4.
                Note that these percentages do not represent the <i>overall</i> percentages of titles on each trending page.
                Instead, I removed any video that was not in one of the above languages and did my analysis on this subset of data.
                As a result, the actual percentages for each language will be slightly smaller.
                However, this percentage difference was minimal when compared to the overall breakdown;
                so, I chose to sacrifice a small amount of accuracy in favour of readability by reducing the number of
                languages presented on each bar.

            <p>
                In both Table 1 and Figure 4, we can see that <span class='number'>3</span> out of <span class='number'>5</span>
                of the trending pages in my dataset had a majority of <span class='emph'>English</span> videos.
                In fact, the United States and United Kingdom were both so English-dominated (over <span class='number'>95%</span>)
                that the remaining percentages of languages are nearly invisible in the language breakdown.
                However, these results were not that far from my expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the UK, <span class='number'>92%</span> of the population considered <span class='emph'>English</span> to be their
                main language in 2013 according to the BBC [<a href='http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-21259401'>source</a>].
                The USA, on the other hand, has approximately <span class='number'>70%</span> of their population made up of native
                <span class='emph'>English</span> speakers [<a href='https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/most-spoken-languages-in-the-us'>source</a>].
                That being said, it was slightly surprising that the American trending page was not slightly more diverse.
                Despite <span class='number'>11%</span> people in the United States speaking Spanish natively, only <span class='number'>5</span>
                video titles in my sampled dataset were in Spanish. In comparison, France's dataset contained <span class='number'>28</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                While it is not reasonable to draw a direct connection between the titles of YouTube's trending page and that
                country's actual diversity, I still found this result to be interesting.
                That being said, it is entirely possible that my sampling process somehow missed many of the non-<span class='emph'>English</span> videos
                and thus skewed the results in one way or the other.
                As a result, these percentages are not actually representative of the languages spoken in a specific country.
                Regardless, this still presents an interesting look at the languages that dominated each trending page.
            </p>
<!--
            <p>
                A result that <i>did</i> surprise me was Canada. As a country that prides itself on being diverse, still an
                overwhelmingly high majority of their videos were <span class='emph'>English</span>: nearly <span class='number'>90%</span>.

            </p> -->

            <hr class='divideme'>

            <p>
                Next, I wanted to see if the trending pages of YouTube were
                becoming more or less dominated by <span class='emph'>English</span> videos over time.
                So, I took the <span class='emph2'>top 3</span> diverse countries from above (France, Germany, and Canada)
                and mapped their English use VS all other languages.
                The results for this can be seen in Figure 5 below.
                It is worth mentioning that I returned to the
               <i>entire</i> language list for this analysis unlike in the analysis above;
               hence, the 'Other' category consists of <span class='number'>76</span> different languages.
            </p>

            <figure class="cf full-width">
                <img src="./images/LanguageTrends_Hover.png" class="img-fluid bottom"/>
                <img src="./images/LanguageTrends.png" class="img-fluid top"/>
                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 5*</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Figure 5 shows that the trend for  <span class='emph'>English</span> videos making the trending page
                is slightly positive whereas the 'Other' category seems to be on a gentle decline.
                While the 'Other' languages outweigh the English videos in this subset of the data on almost every day, there are
                <span class='number'>2</span> days where English overtakes the other languages:
                January 28th and March 5th in 2018. When searching for a cause for this, I found that the Grammy Awards aired on January 28th and
                the Oscars took place on March 4th (the day before March 5th); this may explain the increase in English videos on the trending page
                on these two days.
            </p>

            <hr class='divideme'>
            <p>
                So, based on the above, it is fair to conclude that a video with a title in <span class='emph'>English</span> is more likely
                to trend than titles in any other languages.
                Both French and German are also good choices, although you are less likely to trend globally with these languages as your title.
                Of the  <span class='number'>23</span> videos that made every single trending page, only
                <span class='number'>1</span> of them was classified as non-English.

                However, upon further inspection of this video, it turns out it was actually Troye Sivan's music video for his song 'My My My!'
                Despite being in English, the title had been misclassified by the Google API as <span class='emph2'>Russian</span>.
                So, in reality, not a single one of these videos was non-English.
                Hence, <span class='emph'>English</span> is still the best overall choice if you want to make the trending page.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a reminder, I had to use the <span class='emph2'>sampled</span> version of my dataset
                in order to accommodate for translation limitations in this analysis question.
                It is also worth mentioning that I assumed the language used for the title represents the language used in the video itself.
                Obviously, this is not always the case. However, this still provides a decent approximation while still accommodating for
                my limited translation capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                One other limitation of this analysis is that the Google API used for translation is not <span class='number'>100%</span> accurate with its language detection.
                This was demonstrated above, with Troy Sivan's video being mislabeled as Russian despite being in English.
                However, there is not much that can be done to improve this limitation with today's tools;
                after all, Google Translate is one of the best tools on the market to perform this type of analysis.

            <h2>Question #3</h2>
            <h3>How should you title / tag your video?</h3>
            <p>
                One of the first things a potential viewer will see of your video is the title.
                Because of this, it's important to pick a title that will draw them in and make them want to click.

                Now, there are a variety of techniques that are designed to do just that.
                For example, clickbait, although disingenuous, is one method that is known to work.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to the American Marketing Association, one video with a normal title received only
                <span class='number'>1-million</span> views, whereas the same video, rebranded with a clickbait title,
                was able to pull in <span class='number'>17-million</span>
                [<a href='https://www.ama.org/publications/MarketingInsights/Pages/one-writer-explored-the-marketing-science-behind-clickbait.aspx'>source</a>].
                This is due to the <span class='emph2'>information gap theory</span>, which states that
                "humans have an insatiable appetite to indulge their curiosity"
                [<a href='https://www.ama.org/publications/MarketingInsights/Pages/one-writer-explored-the-marketing-science-behind-clickbait.aspx'>source</a>].
                While clickbait is proven, we want to see if there are any <i>other</i> commonalities in the titles of trending videos.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the analysis to follow, it is worth mentioning that I was once again limited to the <span class='emph2'>sampled</span>
                version of the dataset. Not only did I want to prevent biases towards English titles and words, I was also unsure of the reliability of my
                sentiment analysis tool for non-English words.
                In order to keep things as equal as I could, I chose to stick to my translated titles rather than the full dataset.
            </p>

            <hr class='divideme'>
            <p>
                Let's start by looking at the <span class='emph2'>most used words</span> in the titles of these trending videos
                (excluding stopwords such as 'the,' which provide no insight).
                Beyond that, let's examine whether words of a specific <i>sentiment</i> are more common in titles than others.
                While making a title using these specific words will by no means guarantee trending status,
                it will provide an insight on what <i>kinds</i> of words may increase your chances.

            </p>

            <p>
                The results of this analysis are shown in Figure 6, in which the size of the font corresponds to the number of
                times that specific word occurs in the trending
                video's titles. The colour, in this case, is the algorithm-determined <i>sentiment</i> of that word:
                red is <span class='emph'>positive</span> (a polarity score of greater than <span class='number'>0</span>),
                dark gray is <span class='emph2'>negative</span> (polarity less than <span class='number'>0</span>), and
                light gray is neutral. The library <span class='number'>TextBlob</span> was used for this sentiment score.
            </p>

             <figure class="full-width">
                 <img src="./images/TitleWordCloud.png" class="img-fluid"/>
                 <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 6</figcaption>
             </figure>

             </p>

             <p>
                 From Figure 6, it is apparent right away that this sentiment analysis is hardly a perfect tool.
                 Looking at Figure 6, we can see that some words were classified as either <span class='emph'>positive</span> or
                 <span class='emph2'>negative</span> in some strange ways.
                 For example, 'green' is labeled as <span class='emph2'>negative</span> despite the fact that colours, by nature,
                 are fairly neutral. Perhaps this is due to its usage in idioms such as "green with envy" or the fact that it can
                 be used to describe someone who looks ill.
                 However, you could also consider 'green' in reference to environmental causes, which would instead mean
                 this word should be positive.

                 Similarly, 'live' is classified as <span class='emph'>positive</span>, most likely
                 due to it being interpreted in reference to <i>being alive</i> rather than a live broadcast, which is more likely
                 considering the context of this dataset.
             </p>

             <p>
                 Regardless of the few odd sentiment assignments, there does not seem to be any specific trend to the sentiment of the words used.
                 While there is more <span class='emph'>positivity</span> present in the top-used words than <span class='emph2'>negativity</span>,
                 there is not enough of either to make a sound conclusion.
                 Instead, we can see that titles are overwhelmingly dominated by neutral words, such as names ('Taylor Swift', 'SNL', 'Trump') and
                 basic nouns ('video', 'food', 'cat').
                 Unfortunately, this doesn't give us much to go on for building our own titles; however, it does give us a sense of
                 which topics are more likely to trend.
             </p>

             <hr class='divideme'>
             <p>
                 In order to get a better understanding of trending titles, I trained a Markov chain generator on
                 the titles in order to generate my own.
                 To add an extra element of fun, I also chose a random channel from the list of those who have trended
                 and assigned these to these generated titles.
                 So, what should be the next trending video title according to a Markov chain generator?

                <p>
                    While creating this generator was initially for fun rather than for performing some sort of in-depth analysis,
                    I found that certain patterns seemed to stick in these generated titles that could be reflective of the training dataset.
                    For example, many of the generated titles were either completely capitalized or contained
                    words that were completely capitalized; this suggests using all-caps may be a regular occurrence
                    in actual trending titles, since the generator picked up on this and replicated it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, almost every single time I ran my generation, at least one of the titles included an exclamation mark.
                    Upon further inspection of this, I found that, of the <span class='number'>34,110</span> titles in my
                    sampled dataset, <span class='number'>5,231</span> contained an exclamation mark; this accounts for
                    approximately <span class='number'>15%</span> of the trending titles.
                    In comparison, question marks appeared in about <span class='number'>7.5%</span> and periods made up approximately
                    <span class='number'>12%</span>. Hence, my intuition was right and exclamation points are indeed one of the top-used
                    end of sentence punctuation marks.
                </p>

                <hr class='divideme'>

                <p>
                    While titles are meant to draw users in once they see your video,  tags are used
                    to make sure that users see your video in the first place.
                    The tags of a video are more hidden than the title, but they still contain
                    useful information about the contents of the video itself.
                    Since titles are more visible and meant to be a draw for viewers, they are not
                    necessarily representative of the actual contents: for example, consider the
                    clickbait titles above.
                    Hence, I wanted to see if the top words used in titles were in any way related
                    to the tags.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I started by getting a general understanding of what words were most frequent
                    in tags, similar to the way I did for titles in Figure 6.
                    I did this by gathering the top <span class='number'>200</span> tags and mapping
                    them to a word cloud, where the size of each word represents the number of
                    times it appeared. The color mapping is the same as in Figure 6, where
                    red is <span class='emph'>positive</span>, dark gray is <span class='emph2'>negative</span>,
                    and light gray is neutral. The results can be seen in Figure 7.

                </p>

                   <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 7</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    Since I was not able to translate this column due to my translation limitations,
                    I used the unsampled dataset for this analysis.
                    Interestingly, despite the fact that this dataset contains <span class='number'>78</span>
                    unique languages, a majority of the top-used tags were in English.
                    This reflects the findings of Question 2 above, where English was the majority
                    language for <span class='number'>3</span> out of the <span class='number'>5</span>
                    trending pages and the second-most popular in the other <span class='number'>2</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once again, we can see some odd choices by the sentiment analysis tool.
                    However, ignoring this, we can see that the breakdown of sentiment is very similar to
                    that of the word usage in the titles.
                    The top <span class='number'>200</span> words in titles were approximately
                    <span class='number'>7.5%</span> positive, whereas in tags the top <span class='number'>200</span>
                    were approximately <span class='number'>5.5%</span> positive.
                    For words classified as negative, titles included approximately <span class='number'>3%</span>
                    and tags about <span class='number'>1.5%</span>.
                    Neutral words, in both subsets, were the majority.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now, out of the top <span class='number'>200</span> words in titles and the
                    top <span class='number'>200</span> words in tags, <span class='number'>105</span>
                    of them are the same (in the sampled dataset).
                    So, in regards to my initial question, it seems that titles and tags are indeed
                    very related. In fact, of the top <span class='number'>5</span> most-frequent words
                    in both titles and tags, <span class='number'>3</span> of them were the same.
                    The breakdown of these words is shown in Table 2.

                    Interestingly, the top-used word in tags was 'funny', which did not appear
                    at all in the top <span class='number'>200</span> words used for titles.
                    However, of the top <span class='number'>5</span> words in titles, every
                    single one of them appeared in the top <span class='number'>200</span> tags.
                    Despite this, there was no obvious trend in which words appeared in titles
                    but not tags and vice versa.
                    Words that were included in titles but <i>not</i> in tags include
                    'death', 'commercial', and 'trailers'.
                    On the other hand, some words included in tags but not in titles were
                    'cats' (titles included 'cat' rather than the plural), 'education', and 'television'.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That being said, the main takeaway from this analysis is which <i>topics</i> are likely to trend;
                    for example, cat videos seem to be a good choice based on the number of times 'cat' appears in
                    trending titles.
                    Specific names to include may be Donald Trump, Taylor Swift, and Logan Paul, since these seem to be
                    fairly common occurences in either the titles or tags.
                    For more general ideas, however, it seems as though food, eating, and music are all popular.
                    Another takeway is the fact that, out of all punctuation, it seems as though <i>exclamation marks</i>
                    are the way to go.

			<h2>Question #4</h2>
			<h3>When should you publish your video?</h3>
			<p>
                If your goal is to trend, is there a specific time and/or
                day of the week that will help to achieve this?
                That is the goal of this section of the data analysis.
                In particular, we want to see if there are any trends to whether or not the day you publish
                a video will affect the likelihood it trends and/or the time it takes to make the trending page.
            </p>

            <hr class='divideme'>

            <p>
                First, let's determine whether the day a video is published impacts
                the likelihood of it trending.
                For example, is there a certain weekday that is best to publish your video in order
                for it to trend?
                If we break down the number of videos by the weekday they made the trending page
                as well as the weekday they were published, we may get an idea of whether or not
                there is a relation between weekday and the chances of trending.
                Not only that, but we may be able to draw a conclusion
                on which day is best to publish your video if you wish to trend.
                I began tackling some of these questions using Figure 8, which (for reference) uses the
                <i>unsampled</i> dataset.
            </p>

            <figure class="cf full-width">
                <img src="./images/DayOfTheWeekCount_Hover.png" class="img-fluid bottom"/>
                <img src="./images/DayOfTheWeekCount.png" class="img-fluid top"/>
                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 8*</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                In Figure 8, we can see that the total number of <span class='emph'>trending</span> videos
                on each weekday is fairly uniform. The only exceptions to this are Friday and
                Sunday, which both have slightly fewer trending videos than the other <span class='number'>5</span>
                weekdays. On the other hand, the number of videos <span class='emph2'>published</span> on each day
                is slightly more erratic. Between Monday and Wednesday, the number of trending videos published on
                these days goes down. Wednesday and Thursday have the fewest number of videos published on these
                days total, with Wednesday being the worst of the two.
                Then, the number trends upward to Friday and stays fairly consistent over the weekend.
            </p>

            <p>
                From this, we can see that very few trending videos are <span class='emph2'>published</span> on Wednesday's and Thursday's
                despite the fact that the number of <span class='emph'>trending</span> videos stays pretty stable regardless of the weekday.
                That being said, this could be due to the fact that fewer videos in general are published
                in the middle of the week. Unfortunately, since our data is limited to trending videos only,
                we have no way of knowing how many videos <i>total</i> are published on each day of the week.
                Hence, we do not have enough information to verify this or make any solid conclusions.
                Still, it may be best to avoid these two days when deciding when to make your video live.
            </p>

            <hr class='divideme'>

            <p>
                Since it is difficult to determine the <i>likelihood</i> of trending depending on the
                day a video was published, let's instead see if there is any correlation between the day a video
                was published and how <i>long</i> it takes to make the trending page.
                In order to calculate this value, which we will hereby call the <span class='emph2'>wait time</span>,
                we took the day a video made the trending page and subtracted the day it was published.
                We converted this value to the approximate number of days between the two dates in order
                to simplify the output of this calculation.
                Once we had this value for every single video in our unsampled dataset, we could proceed
                with the rest of our analysis.
            </p>

                Figure 9 shows the breakdown of both the <span class='emph2'>average</span> and
                <span class='emph'>median</span> wait time for the videos
                that trended on each day in our dataset. From this, we can very clearly see that
                the <span class='emph2'>average</span> is driven up by a small subset of videos,
                since the <span class='emph'>median</span> wait time is consistently much
                lower than the average. Despite this, it seems as though the <span class='emph2'>average</span>
                is currently on a downward trend and, in fact, may be becoming more consistent overall.
            </p>

            <p>
                From the start of the trending videos in 2017 until Febuary of 2018, there were
                large dips and spikes in the average wait time. For example, the largest spike was on
                January 31st, 2018, where <span class='number'>2</span> videos from 2007, a video from 2008,
                and <span class='number'>3</span> videos from 2011 all made the trending page.
                A few of the oldest videos that trended on this day are the following:

            <p>
                I noticed right away that, of the top <span class='number'>10</span> oldest videos that trended on January 31st,
                <span class='number'>9</span> of them trended only in Germany. In fact,
                <span class='number'>6</span> of them were music videos by a British band called
                'The Fall,' and another was about the lead singer of this band, Mark E. Smith. When I looked into why this was the
                case, I found that Smith passed away on January 24th, 2018, a mere <span class='number'>7</span> days before
                [<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_(band)'>source</a>].
                Hence, this explains the mass resurfacing of these videos, many of which were over a decade old at the time of trending.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, in the last <span class='number'>5</span> weeks, the intensity of the dips and spikes of
                the average wait time seems to have smoothed out. Of course, it is entirely possible an extreme event
                such as what happened on January 31st may drive this wait time up once again.
                Still, the most recent weeks were much more stable than any other span of time in my dataset.
                That being said, the <span class='emph2'>average</span> wait time does not seem to show
                any significant evidence to suggest that publishing time impacts the time it takes a video to trend.
            </p>

            <hr class='divideme'>

            <p>
                While the <span class='emph2'>average</span> wait time did not tell us much about whether or not
                publishing time impacts how long a video takes to trend, I was interested in finding out whether or not the
                <span class='emph'>median</span> wait time told a different story.
                Since the <span class='emph2'>average</span> was so significantly higher than the <span class='emph'>median</span>
                in Figure 9 above, it was extremely difficult to draw any firm conclusions on the <span class='emph'>median</span> without looking
                at it seperately. Hence, in order to take a closer look at the <span class='emph'>median</span> wait time,
                Figure 10 is the same as Figure 10 but does not include the <span class='emph2'>average</span>;
                in this graph, the days that are highlighted with a darker gray are the weekend.
            </p>

            <figure class="cf full-width">
                <img src="./images/WaitTimeTrends-Median_Hover.png" class="img-fluid bottom"/>

                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 10*</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Right away, there seems to be a much more predictable pattern to the <span class='emph'>median</span> wait time
                in comparison to the <span class='emph2'>average</span>.
                Quite consistently, the <span class='emph'>median</span> wait time seems to dip in the middle of the week and
                spike around the weekend. Of course, there are exceptions to this general pattern; once again,
                January 31st shows a larger-than-normal spike in the wait time in the middle of the week.
                Still, this pattern is consistent enough that I believe it is fair to draw conclusions from the <span class='emph'>median</span>,
                unlike with the <span class='emph2'>average</span> wait time.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hence, according to Figure 10, videos that trend in the middle of the week tend to have a short
                wait time than those that trend on the weekend. The median around this time is usually between
                <span class='number'>1</span> and <span class='number'>1.25</span> days;
                so, if you want to have a chance at trending <i>faster</i>, this suggests it is best to post your video
                somewhere between a Sunday and a Tuesday.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is worth mentioning that I originally tried to look at both Figure 9 and 10 from the perspective of the publish date
                rather than the trending date. However, due to the large variety of publish dates in my dataset, this resulted in a
                graph that was messy and much harder to draw conclusions from.
                Since anomalies such as January 31st existed, the graphs contained large gaps which skewed the wait time overall.
                While focusing on trending date may not provide as strong of a conclusion, at least
                it is easy to interpret.

            <h2>The following questions were changed...</h2>
            <p>
                As of Project 1.1, the next two questions I posed were as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Question 5:</b> Has sponsored content gotten more popular on the trending page?</li>
                    <li><b>Question 6:</b> Does a mainstream controversy impact your likelihood of trending?</li>
                </ul>
                However, after exploring these questions and attempting to answer them, I found that my
                dataset did not contain the necessary information in order to draw any interesting points.
                As a result, I had to change the last 2 questions of my analysis to something more feasible
                with the data that was available.
            </p>
            <p>
                In regards to the proposed Question 5, my dataset is not over a long enough time
                period in order to see any trend for a specific channel. I've been hearing complaints about
                this specific topic from YouTube creators for around a year, and since my dataset contains only
                the most recent 5 months, I cannot really see if the amount of this content present on the trending page
                has actually increased. So, I decided it would be best to find a question that might tell us
                a bit more about our dataset.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the proposed Question 6, I had difficulty determining exactly how to answer this once I
                put more thought into it. My original plan was to focus on two channels that I knew recently fell
                under criticism: Logan Paul and Shane Dawson.
                Their contraversies each fell within the timespan of my dataset, so I thought I made be able
                to track the impact of this. However, I ended up not knowing how to measure exactly what an 'impact'
                would look like. Both channels had videos on the trending page before <i>and</i> after their
                respective contraversies, but there was not enough videos in either case to draw any firm
                conclusions. Hence, I chose to drop this question as well.

			<h2>Question #5</h2>
			<h3>Do views actually matter?</h3>
            <p>
                According to YouTube's own guidelines, there are <span class='number'>4</span> determining
                factors that go into deciding whether or not a video will make the trending page
                [<a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7239739?hl=en">source</a>]:
                <ol>
                    <li>The video is appealing to a wide range of viewers.</li>
                    <li>The video is <i>not</i> misleading, clickbaity or sensational.</li>
                    <li>The video captures the breadth of what’s happening on YouTube and in the world.</li>
                    <li>The video is surprising or novel.</li>
                </ol>
                They claim the things that are considered when making this decision include, but are
                not limited to, the number of views, how fast the views were accumulated, whether the views
                come from external sources, as well as the age of the video
                [<a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7239739?hl=en">source</a>].
                Since views seem to be the focus of this decision process, let's explore some of the anomalies in this regard.
                Along the way, we may be able to gather some information about what else goes into making a video trend.
            </p>

            <hr class='divideme'>

            <p>
                First, let's take a look at the videos that performed the worst in regards to views.
                We saw in Question 1 above that, in general, music videos perform the best when it
                comes to total views, whereas the 'Shows', 'Nonprofits & Activism', and 'Travel & Events' categories
                tend to have the fewest views overall. That being said, of the worst-viewed trending videos,
                which category is the most prevelant? This might give us some information as to why such low-performing
                videos made the trending page to begin with.
                In order to find this out, I took the top <span class='number'>1,000</span>
                videos with the lowest views from my unsampled dataset and counted how many fell into each category.
            </p>

            <figure class="cf full-width">
                <img src="./images/WorstViewedCategories_Hover.png" class="img-fluid bottom"/>
                <img src="./images/WorstViewedCategories.png" class="img-fluid top"/>
                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 11*</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Figure 11 shows us that, out of the <span class='number'>1,000</span> lowest-viewed trending
                videos, a majority of them fell under the <span class='emph'>People & Blogs</span> category.
                However, the top <span class='number'>4</span> all came fairly close to tieing in this regard: the top
                category was <span class='emph'>People & Blogs</span> with <span class='number'>166</span> videos, however,
                next in line was <span class='emph2'>Sports</span> with <span class='number'>162</span>, a difference of
                only <span class='number'>4</span> videos. In third place was
                <span class='emph2'>Entertainment</span> with <span class='number'>148</span>,
                and the fourth-most unviewed category was <span class='emph2'>News & Politics</span> with <span class='number'>145</span>.
                The remaining categories all had <span class='number'>72</span> or less videos total, which shows
                us that these top <span class='number'>4</span> all perform <i>much</i> worse in general when compared to the other categories.
            </p>

            <p>
                The results of this analysis surprised me. When I originally tried this and took only the top
                <span class='number'>100</span> lowest-viewed trending videos, I found that <span class='emph2'>News & Politics</span>
                was, by far, the most common category. This made sense to me, since it YouTube would want to
                push breaking news to the trending page <i>before</i> it gets views; once a news video is seen
                by enough people, chances are that specific story is already out-of-date. So, making news videos trend regardless of
                views makes sense. However, when I changed this number and looked at the <span class='number'>1,000</span> videos instead, this changed:
                <span class='emph'>People & Blogs</span> now had the most unviewed trending videos.
            </p>

            <p>
                I cannot think of a clear justification as to why this might be the case.
                Unlike with <span class='emph2'>News & Politics</span>, it does not seem as though videos in the
                <span class='emph'>People & Blogs</span> category are time-sensitive.
                One possible explanation I came up with was that YouTube has certain creators that
                they push to the trending page regardless of views.
                However, upon further exploration of this possibility, this theory was unsupported.
                There was no single creator that seemed to be overepresented in this category, or in any other
                for that matter. The same justification that exists for <span class='emph2'>News & Politics</span>
                can be applied to <span class='emph2'>Sports</span>, but the justification for <span class='emph'>People & Blogs</span>
                as well as <span class='emph2'>Entertainment</span> leaves me stumped.
            </p>

            <hr class='divideme'>
            <p>
                In order to investigate this further, let's take a look at the <i>median</i> wait time of the <span class='emph'>People & Blogs</span>
                category in comparison to all other categories. While we already showed that it is unlikely that YouTube is pushing certain
                creators to the trending page in this category, it may be the case that these videos tend to trend <i>faster</i> than any other
                category. This could explain why a majority of the most unviewed videos fell under this category, since if they trend
                faster they may not have the same chance to rack up views.
            </p>

            <figure class="cf full-width">
                <img src="./images/WaitTimeTrends-Median-ByCategory_Hover.png" class="img-fluid bottom"/>
                <img src="./images/WaitTimeTrends-Median-ByCategory.png" class="img-fluid top"/>
                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 12*</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                According to Figure 12, the median wait time for  <span class='emph'>People & Blogs</span> is <i>consistently</i> lower than
                the combined median wait time for all  <span class='emph2'>other</span> categories.
                This suggests that that the reason this category has so many unviewed videos may be that they tend to be pushed
                to the trending page faster than other categories. Of course, there may be a certain category that is driving the
                 <span class='emph2'>other</span> mean up. Still, this provides a reasonable justification for why this category
                 is so overepresented in the lowest-viewed <span class='number'>1,000</span> trending videos.
            </p>
            <hr class='divideme'>

            <p>
                As an aside, let's look at the worst-viewed videos on each country's trending page.
                Out of the unsampled dataset, there were <span class='number'>70</span> unique videos
                with less than <span class='number'>1,000</span> views at the time of trending.
                These videos trended in Germany, France, the UK, and the United States, but interestingly not a single
                one of them made the trending page in Canada. The lowest-viewed Canadian video,
                on the other hand, had <i>exactly</i> <span class='number'>1,000</span> views at the time of trending.
                The lowest viewed videos (at the time of trending) for each country are displayed in Table 3.

            <p>
                Now, a majority (<span class='number'>3</span> out of <span class='number'>5</span>) of these videos
                comes from the <span class='emph2'>'News & Politics'</span> category.
                This goes along with our justification above, since news tends to be more time
                sensitive than any other category on the trending page.
                That being said, we know that this does not hold once we look at a larger subset of low-viewed
                videos. Still, it is interesting to see exactly what types of videos are pushed to the trending page
                for each country.
            </p>

            <hr class='divideme'>

            <p>
                Since so many videos made the trending page despite having very limited views, it seems as though
                views actually do <i>not</i> matter when it comes to trending. However, that is only the case for
                certain categories of videos. For example, there were <span class='number'>8,876</span> total videos
                that made the trending page under the <span class='emph2'>'News & Politics'</span> category. Hence, of these,
                approximately <span class='number'>1.6%</span> of them fell into subset of the <span class='number'>1,000</span>
                lowest-viewed videos. On the other hand, the <i>most commonly trending</i> category is <span class='emph2'>'Entertainment'</span>
                with <span class='number'>32,316</span> total trending videos; so only about <span class='number'>0.5%</span> of this
                category was low viewed. This suggests that views seem to matter less for news videos than for entertainment, for example.

			<h2>Question #6</h2>
			<h3>What makes a controversial video?</h3>
            <p>
                Now, our analysis thus far has focused on what you <i>should</i> do, and we have yet to really
                discuss what you <i>shouldn't</i> do. Obviously, all of the videos on our dataset did indeed make
                the trending page, so they've each done something right in that regard. That being said,
                while unpopular or contraversial videos may bring in views, they are not necessarily the best
                if you wish to recieve positive feedback. So, let's look at what topics you should <span class='emph2'>avoid</span>
                when making videos.
            </p>

            <hr class='divideme'>

            <p>
                First, let's take a look at the most positively and negatively received trending videos.
                To do this analysis, we first determined the breakdown of likes to dislikes by normalizing these
                two columns; hence, rather than having the actual <i>number</i> of likes and dislikes, we instead had the
                percentage breakdown of likes to dislikes for each video. This was done on the sampled dataset, since we inteded to perform
                a similar title analysis as shown in Question 3.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once we had the likes to dislikes ratio, we filtered out the videos with less than <span class='number'>50,000</span>
                views. Since some videos made the trending page despite having limited views, these seemed to skew our ratios since
                a single dislike was weighted much heavier when there were fewer likes to balance it out. Since our assumption was
                that a contraversial video would receive quite a few views, and in order to accomodate for this unbalance, we
                chose to remove any relatively unviewed videos from our consideration.

            <p>
                The breakdown of words used in the titles of the most and least contraversial videos can be seen in Figure 13.
                The figure on the left represents the most-used words for the top <span class='number'>1,000</span> videos with the highest
                <span class='emph'>likes</span> to dislikes ratio, whereas the one on the right shows the breakdown of words for the
                <span class='number'>1,000</span> vidoes with the highest <span class='emph2'>dislikes</span> to likes ratio.
                For the sake of this analysis, we will consider the videos represented on the right to be those that are
                <i>contraversial</i>.
            </p>

            <p>
                This suggests that videos about <span class='emph2'>Roy Moore</span> and the Moore Campaign are some of the most
                contraversial on the trending page. The chairman of the FCC, <span class='emph2'>Ajit Pai</span>, is also a fairly
                contraversial topic. I found it interesting that the phrase 'Official Trailer' made this list; however, upon
                further inspection, I found that this was most likely influenced by the trailer for rebooted television show
                'ReBoot: The Guardian Code' [<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8B5dqjsZUs'>source</a>]. While other
                trailers also accounted for this addition, this was easily the most contraversial trailer on the list.
                We can see multiple phrases related to this specific trailer in this figure, including 'Guardian Code' and
                'Code Official.'
            </p>

            <p>
                On the other hand, some of the <i>least</i> contraversial video topics are BTS (a Korean pop band), Christmas, and
                Roberto Carlos. Interestingly, 'Trailer' also makes this word list, although at a much lower frequency than
                'Official Trailer' for the contraversial videos. Hence, if you want to avoid contraversies, perhaps just stick
                to vidoes about dogs, yoga, cats, and other topics present in the left figure.

            <p>
                Now that we know what topics make a contraversial video, let's see if people tend to comment more on videos
                that make this list. I would expect this to be true, since my belief is that people would have more drive to
                comment on something they disagree with versus something they agree with; however, let's test this hypothesis.
                In order to do this, we plotted the dislikes ratio versus the number of comments, where the size of each
                point corresponds to the number of views that specific video got.
            </p>

            <figure class="cf full-width">
                <img src="./images/Dislikes_Hover.png" class="img-fluid bottom"/>
                <img src="./images/Dislikes.png" class="img-fluid top"/>
                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 14*</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                From Figure 14, it seems as though the <i>opposite</i> is true (excluding a few outliers): videos with a more
                positive reaction tend to receive more comments. However, it is worth noticing that the most contraversial
                videos also recieved fewer views in general, which would explain why they also received fewer comments.
            </p>

            <p>
                That being said, let's look at some of the outliers in Figure 14. Two of them were created by the YouTuber
                Logan Paul, who recently made mainstream news after publishing a video that included the uncensored body of a suicide victim.
                Both of these outlier videos are related to this contraversy: 'So Sorry' and 'Suicide: Be Here Tomorrow.'
