			<h2>Question #1</h2>
            <h3>What genre should your video be?</h3>
			<!-- <h3>What genre will give you the best user interaction?</h3> -->
			<p>
                The trending page of YouTube is broken down into <span class='number'>15</span> different categories.
                One possible subset of the more popular genres, in no particular order, is as follows:

                <!-- 'Autos & Vehicles', 'Comedy', 'Education', 'Entertainment',
                       'Film & Animation', 'Gaming', 'Howto & Style', 'Music',
                       'News & Politics', 'Nonprofits & Activism', 'People & Blogs',
                       'Pets & Animals', 'Science & Technology', 'Shows', 'Sports',
                       'Travel & Events' -->

                <ul class="row">
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Comedy</li>
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Gaming</li>
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Entertainment</li>
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Music</li>
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Howto & Style</li>
                     <li class="list-unstyled-item col-md-6">Sports</li>
                </ul>

                With such a large variety of options to choose from, which category should you make content for?
                Obviously, the most obvious answer would be to make content for the genre you are passionate about and talented in.
                After all, if you are hopeleslly tonedeaf, it may not be worth your time to persue a career in music.
            </p>

            <p>
                That being said, let us approach this problem as though each genre of video is equally likely and enjoyable.
                Considering this, what factors would influence our decision on which category to aim for?
            </p>
            <hr class='divideme'>
            <p>
                One of the first things that comes to mind when hearing that a video is 'popular' on YouTube is likely the number of
                views a specific video gets. It is unlikely, for example, that a video with under <span class='number'>500</span> views
                would be considered 'popular' by the general YouTube audience.
                Since the goal of creating content for this platform is <i>most likely</i> to make these types of 'popular' videos,
                it makes sense to start by looking at this factor for each category.
            </p>

            <figure class="full-width">
                <img src="./images/CategoryViewsTotal.png" class="img-fluid"/>
                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 1</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                As can be seen above, the <span class='emph'>Music</span> category far outweighs the other genres in terms of overall views.
                In comparison to the second-most viewed category (Entertainment), <span class='emph'>Music</span> has approximately
                <span class='number'>30-million</span> more views; this is nearly double the number of views!
                With some thought, this result is fairly unsurprising.
                First off, music is universably shareable.
                This is especially true due to the lack of a language barrier when it comes to music in comparison to other forms of digital media.
                Although you may not understand the lyrics of a particular song, that by no means impacts your ability to enjoy it.
                As a result, it is not uncommon for music videos to trend in multiple countries.
                For example, here are just a few of the <span class='number'>55</span> different music videos that made the trending page of every
                country in our dataset:

                <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
                    <p class="mb-0">'MIC Drop (Steve Aoki Remix)' Official MV</p>
                    <footer class="blockquote-footer">By <cite title="Source Title">BTS (방탄소년단)</cite></footer>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
                    <p class="mb-0">End Game ft. Ed Sheeran, Future</p>
                    <footer class="blockquote-footer">By <cite title="Source Title">Taylor Swift</cite></footer>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
                    <p class="mb-0">Man of the Woods (Official Video)</p>
                    <footer class="blockquote-footer">By <cite title="Source Title">Justin Timberlake</cite></footer>
                </blockquote>


                In comparison, the next most universally shared category was Entertainment with only <span class='number'>29</span> videos that made every trending page,
                which is almost <span class='emph2'>half</span> of the number of music videos that met the same condition.
                The category 'Film & Animation' had <span class='number'>15</span> of these videos, and all the remaining categories had <span class='number'>10</span> or less.
                Of the fifteen possible categories, <span class='number'>3</span> of them had the minimum value of <span class='number'>1</span>.
                This helps to  illustrate our idea that music videos are more universally shareable in comparison to the other categories.
            </p>

            <p>
                Music videos also have one of the highest <span class='emph2'>replayability</span> factors in comparison to the other categories.
                It is not uncommon for people without access to some other music streaming service to make use of YouTube's multitude of musical content.
                After all, this is the reason why the paid-for-subscription-service YouTube Red has an option to stream music in a manner not unlike Spotify.
                This is just another explanation for why this category dominates the other categories in terms of views.
            </p>
            <hr class='divideme'>
            <p>
                Despite the <span class='emph'>Music</span> category getting the most views overall,
                the future is not-so-bleak for the other categories.
                Figure 2 below illustrates the number of views (per day) of music videos in comparison to all other categories.
                It is worth mentioning that this figure was constructed using the <span class='emph2'>sampled</span> version of our dataset.
                This helped to normalize the results, since only <span class='number'>5</span> videos from each category (per day) were included.
                I tried constructing this same graph with both versions of my dataset, and I found this one to be the most interesting.
            </p>

            <figure class="full-width">
                <img src="./images/CategoryViewsOverTime.png" class="img-fluid"/>
                  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 2</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Figure 2 shows that the views of the videos in the <span class='emph'>Music</span> category as well as
                all <span class='emph2'>other</span> categories (when considered as a whole) are on the rise.
                In fact, the views trend line for 'Other' seems to have a slightly steeper slope than the one for 'Music'.
                This shows that, while music videos may get more views overall than all other categories,
                views in general are on an upward trend.
                As a result, the future of views looks promising <i>regardless</i> of the video category you choose.

            </p>
            <hr class='divideme'>
            <p>
                However, views are not all that matters when it comes to choosing a category that fits you best.
                For example, you may be someone who values user comments and direct communication with your audience
                more than simply the number of views.
                On the other hand, you may be heavily impacted by negative feedback, so you'd prefer to pick a category
                that has mostly positive feedback.
                These are other factors, besides views, that may impact your decision for which category to produce
                content for.
            </p>
            <p>
                Figure 3 below shows the breakdown of user interaction per category, as described by
                the average number of comments, likes, and dislikes on the videos.
                Since the views of every category far outweighed any other interaction factor (and since I've already
                heavily discussed views above), I chose not to include the percentage of user interaction that comes
                from views. This helped give more insight into the other factors.
            </p>

            <figure class="full-width">
                <img src="./images/InteractionBreakdown.png" class="img-fluid"/>
                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 3</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Using Figure 3, we can answer the above hypothetical examples. If user comments are an important factor for you when making your videos,
                then the category <span class='emph2'>'Nonprofits & Activism'</span> is for you.
                This can be seen by the fact that this category has <span class='number'>21%</span> of its user interaction coming from comments,
                which is the most out of any other category. Interestingly, this category also has a higher than average percentage of
                dislikes, coming in at <span class='number'>14.5%</span>. As a result, this may not be the best category for the second scenario where
                negative feedback is extremely undesirable. Instead, the best categories for this scenario would be <span class='emph2'>'Pets & Animals'</span> (with only <span class='number'>1.7%</span> of
                user interaction coming from dislikes) or <span class='emph2'>'Comedy'</span> (which has only <span class='number'>2.7%</span>).

			<h2>Question #2</h2>
			<h3>Which language should your title be?</h3>
			<p>
                Depending on the language you speak, it's possible that your video may not trend.
                After all, videos in languages that do not fall into the majority limits the potential size of the audience, which goes against
                the fundamental idea behind the trending page.
                Trending videos are meant to target as wide of an audience as possible, so it makes sense to publish a video in one of the top
                languages if you want to increase your chances of making this list.
            </p>

            <hr class='divideme'>

            <p>
                Hence, let's start by looking at the diversity of each trending page. In the context of this analysis, <span class='emph2'>diversity</span>
                is measured by the number of unique lanugages detected for the titles of each country's page.

                Overall, my sampled dataset had a total of <span class='number'>78</span> unique languages used for the titles.
                Hence, the number of unique languages is most
                likely actually much larger. Still, I was able to get a good understanding of the breakdown of the <span class='emph2'>majority</span>
                languages, and this analysis can be seen in Table 1.

                In order to get a more in-depth analysis of the language use in each trending page, I took the <span class='emph2'>top <span class='number'>5</span></span>
                languages from each country and mapped the percentage breakdown of the resulting shortened language list for each of the trending pages.
                Since there was a lot of overlap between these top <span class='number'>5</span>, I ended up only looking at <span class='number'>12</span>
                different languages for each trending page:

                The percentage breakdown of each of these languages can be seen in Figure 4.
                Note that the percentages represented in this graph do not represent the <i>overall</i> percentages of titles on each trending page.
                Instead, I removed any video that was not in one of the above languages and did my analysis on this subset of data.
                As a result, the actual percentages for each language will be slightly smaller.
                That being said, when I tried to represent the <i>real</i> percentages, the resulting graph was e

                Since <span class='number'>3</span> out of <span class='number'>5</span> of the trending pages had
                <span class='emph'>English</span> as the majority language, I wanted to see if there was any trend

            <p>

                As a reminder, I had to use the <span class='emph2'>sampled</span> version of my dataset in order
                to accomodate for translation limitations in this analysis question.

                It is also worth mentioning that, throughout this analysis, I assumed that the language used for the title represents the language used in the video itself.
                Obviously, this is not always the case. However, this still provides a decent approximation while still accomodating for
                my limited translation capabilities (as discussed above).
                One other limitatio9n of this analysis is that the Google API used for translation is not <span class='number'>100%</span> accurate with its language detection.
